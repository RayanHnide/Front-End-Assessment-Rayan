 
project name: 
Assessment front end

work description:
 
The project was successfully completed using the following modern technologies:
Next.js 15 for dynamic application development
TypeScript for robust and precise coding
Tailwind CSS and ShadeCn for a fully responsive, high-quality user interface design across all devices
Throughout the project, I ensured adherence to best coding practices and leveraged a component-based structure to avoid redundancy and
facilitate maintenance. The design was carefully optimized to be fully responsive, adapting seamlessly across different devices.
Additionally, I used Jest to perform comprehensive tests on components with integrated API calls, ensuring functionality and reliability across
all project elements.
Within the allocated timeframe, I was able to accomplish all required tasks and hope my work meets your expectations. I am eager for the
opportunity to join your esteemed company, where I can contribute my expertise, collaborate closely with your team, and benefit from the
collective knowledge within your organization. I am confident that my ability to learn quickly will allow me to add real value to the team.
Thank you for your time and consideration.
